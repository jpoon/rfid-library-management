RFID Library Management System
==============================

As radio frequency identification (RFID) technology continues to mature, the technology is becoming increasingly affordable. 
As a direct result of the reduced cost for the technology, RFID is being applied in a variety of forms. 
One area where RFID technology is being utilized is in libraries. 
The majority of libraries maintain their catalogue using barcodes. Although barcodes are relatively low cost and extremely accurate compared to manual key entry, there are many limitations to the technology including: 

1.	Bar‐coded items may only be scanned one at a time 
2.	If the barcode becomes scratched or damaged, the barcode reader will be unable to read it 
3.	There is no simple way to detect misplaced books 

RFID poses numerous benefits over the current barcode system being used in University of British Columbia (UBC) libraries including faster scanning of items, a theoretical longer scanning distance, easier to maintain large catalogues, and better theft detection rate. Additionally, as RFID tags are capable of being scanned through objects, circulation staff no longer need to repetitively open a book cover to scan a book’s barcode; this can substantially decrease the amount of repetitive‐motion injuries. 
Our implementation of the RFID Library Management system will provide both patrons and librarians with a simplified self check‐out/check‐in procedure, a high‐speed book inventory tracking system, detection of miss‐shelved books, and the ability to guide a user to a book in the library.
